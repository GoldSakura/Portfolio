Get Good Projects

I have toyed with the idea of becoming a better programmer for the most part of my life, but I hardly ever pushed through. This time, I have decided to publicize the projects I get involved with as I improve my skills. I intend to take this one project at a time,
and crossing the bridge when I get to the "Now what?" question. One thing is certain, I want to code even when I am 99.

File Organization

Projects are numbered 1_100project or 1_50project or 1_smth to differentiate the courses I have undertaken throughout the process. As of now, I am following 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu, and 50 Projects in 50 Days by Brad Traversy and Florin Pop.
